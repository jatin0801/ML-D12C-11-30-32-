Taking into consideration the increasing prices of oil our regression model can be used to predict oil prices for future. <br>
KNN, SVM and Decision tree algorithms are used to predict wether a person of a particular age group earning a particular salary will buy oil or not. <br>

# Algorithms implemented
## 1) kNN : <br>
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. It's easy to implement and understand, but has a major drawback of becoming significantly slows as the size of that data in use grows.<br>
In this algorithim the dataset consists of age and monthly income of a particular person as input. Wether the person will buy the oil or no is taken as output value.
0 indicates that the person will not buy it and 1 indicates that the person will buy it.
## 2) SVM : <br>
“Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges.
In this algorithim the dataset consists of age and monthly income of a particular person as input. Wether the person will buy the oil or no is taken as output value.<br>
0 indicates that the person will not buy it and 1 indicates that the person will buy it.
## 3) Decicion Tree <br>
In a decision tree, each leaf node is assigned a class label. The non-terminal nodes, which include the root and other internal nodes, contain attribute test conditions to separate records that have different characteristics.<br>
In this algorithim the dataset consists of age and monthly income of a particular person as input. Wether the person will buy the oil or no is taken as output value.<br>
Here,<br>
In age: <br>
20-29 years = 1 <br>
30-39 years = 2 <br>
40+ years = 3 <br>
In salary, <br>
20,000-29,000 = 1 <br>
30,000-39,000 = 2 <br>
40,000+ = 3 <br>
0 indicates that the person will not buy it and 1 indicates that the person will buy it.<br>
## 4) Linear Regression: <br>
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables).<br>
In this algorithim the dataset consists of age and monthly income of a particular person as input. Wether the person will buy the oil or no is taken as output value.<br>
Here,<br>
In age: <br>
20-29 years = 1 <br>
30-39 years = 2 <br>
40+ years = 3 <br>
In salary, <br>
20,000-29,000 = 1 <br>
30,000-39,000 = 2 <br>
40,000+ = 3 <br>
0 indicates that the person will not buy it and 1 indicates that the person will buy it.
