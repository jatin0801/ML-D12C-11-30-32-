Taking into consideration the increasing prices of oil our regression model can be used to predict oil prices for future. <br>
KNN, SVM and Decision tree algorithms are used to predict wether a person of a particular age group earning a particular salary will buy oil or not. <br>

# Algorithms implemented
1) kNN : <br>
2) The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. It's easy to implement and understand, but has a major drawback of becoming significantly slows as the size of that data in use grows.<br>
In this algorithim the dataset consists of age and monthly income of a particular person as input. Wether the person will buy the oil or no is taken as output value.
0 indicates that the person will not buy it and 1 indicates that the person will buy it.
2) SVM : <br>
“Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges.
In this algorithim the dataset consists of age and monthly income of a particular person as input. Wether the person will buy the oil or no is taken as output value.<br>
0 indicates that the person will not buy it and 1 indicates that the person will buy it.
5) Decicion Tree
6) Linear Regression
